= Caveat =

The old BuildCodeInEclipse page is now old.  So I am trying to create new instructions here, but this is a work in progress.  So please bear with me.

= Introduction =

The first thing to recognize is that this is a project that is built using Maven, and leverages Maven's Dependency management.  I highly recommend Maven.  Also Maven Central Repository is becoming a large place to easily find dependent libraries and lots of good meta-data; that is why I think that every Java developer has to become familiar with it, if not actively use it.

If you're familiar with Maven, have at the project, if you're not familiar with Maven, we'll give you a few pointers to get you started using our code, but recommend that you go and learn about Maven fully.
