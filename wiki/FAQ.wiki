#Frequently Asked Questions

  * When requesting an XML document from Facebook, I get nothing back. I see [#document: null] in my debugger.
    * [#document: null] isn't nothing! The .toString() method on the Document object is trying to communicate that the Document's root element's "node value" is not defined. Unfortunatly, it chooses to represent that as [#document: null] which is just plain confusing. Use the com.google.code.facebookapi.XMLTestUtils.print(Node dom); utility method which is checked into the facebook-java-api source tree to pretty-print your Document and see what's really in there.
