SUMMARY:

A) Maven deploy

mvn release:prepare
 - it will ask what the release version is (3 times) (should use default)
 - it will ask what the tag directory name for release will be, it should be release-#####
   (this will create a directory under /tags/release-#####)
 - it will ask what the next development version is (3 times) (should use default)

mvn release:perform
 - it will do a full build and deploy into repository
   - this will include jar files, source files and javadoc files (but not distribution file)
   - will have to have proper ssh identities setup so as to not force password or failure

B) Make up distribution zip file

cd /tags/release-#####
mvn clean install site deploy
 - do another clean install
 - build the site (for dist)
 - do another deploy

cd facebook-java-api
mvn assembly:assembly
 - build the assembly (zip distribution file)

 - DONE, you should see a message near the end like so:
   [INFO] Building zip: /local/fern/work/facebook-java-api/tags/release-#####/facebook-java-api/target/facebook-java-api-#####-bin.zip

C) Upload to Google Code
 - upload to: http://code.google.com/p/facebook-java-api/downloads/list
  - set as Featured (to show up on project homepage)
  - un feature old release (to remove from project homepage)
 - maybe mark a really old release as deprecated ( so it will not show up by default )


D) Update front page
 - update: http://code.google.com/p/facebook-java-api/admin
  - to say we have new release..


E) Update wiki
 - easier to do this through svn.
 - simply search for the previous version, and edit it as appropriate, then checkin all changes.
