#summary Describes the interplay between facebook.xsd, schema.xsd and facebook.xsd.diff

= Introduction =

The schema.xsd file used to generate the Java XML Bindings (JAXB) differs slightly from what Facebook makes available in facebook.xsd. The differences between the files are maintained in facebook.xsd.diff and this file should be updated whenever either facebook.xsd or schema.xsd is updated.

= Details =

A Maven plugin is used to generate the Java bindings. The details are in facebook-api/facebook-java-api-schema/pom.xml.

facebook.xsd is published at http://api.facebook.com/1.0/facebook.xsd and defines the response formats. Because this is a REST API, the request formats do not have an XML schema or similar; instead we rely on the API documentation at http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/API

Could someone who knows the process please comment:
What's the purpose of the facebook.xsd.diff when we could relatively easily create a diff (patch) whenever we want to. Is someone looking from Facebook looking at the discrepancies?
