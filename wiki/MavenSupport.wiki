On the road to getting our releases into the central repository, we
have to setup our own repository that the central one can look at.  We
also need to setup our own repository to host snapshots..

So unless we find a better place, I just created a server on my hoste
( dreamhost ).  You can how add this repository as a snapshot
repository and get access to the latest code, without having to build
it yourself.  Please let me know if you have any questions or
feedback!

add this repository to your project's pom:

    <repository>
      <id>mrepo-happyfern-snapshot</id>
      <url>http://mrepo.happyfern.com/maven2-snapshot/</url>
      <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
      </snapshots>
    </repository>

then you have access to this dependency:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.facebook.api</groupId>
      <artifactId>facebook-java-api</artifactId>
      <version>1.8-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
